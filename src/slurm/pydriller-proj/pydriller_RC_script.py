Module Name: pydriller_RC_script.py

Description:
    This python script is a generalized version of VHP_ffmpeg.py. This script will read and process a list of 
    git commit hashes that represent patches to CVE vulnerabilities from a json file. The patch commmit will
    help locate the vulnerability inducing commit hashes by utilizing pydriller's implementation of the
    popular SZZ algorithm. 

    Once found, the vulnerability inducing commit hashes will be written to a new json file corresponding to their
    respective patch inducing commit & CVE.
