Module Name: pydriller_RC_script.py

Description:
    This python script is a generalized version of VHP_ffmpeg.py. This script will read and process a list of 
    git commit hashes that correlate to documented CVE vulnerabilities from a json file. The patch commmit will
    help locate the vulnerability inducing commit hashes by utilizing pydriller's implementation of the
    popular SZZ algorithm. 

    Once found, the vulnerability inducing commit hashes will be written to a new json file corresponding to their
    respective patch inducing commit & CVE.

    This first version of the script won't be able to guarantee any degree of accuracy because it simply gathers data.

    Algorithm Process & Steps:
        1.

    abstract = "Software repositories contain historical and valuable information about the overall development of software systems. Mining software repositories (MSR) is nowadays considered one of the most interesting growing fields within software engineering. MSR focuses on extracting and analyzing data available in software repositories to uncover interesting, useful, and actionable information about the system. Even though MSR plays an important role in software engineering research, few tools have been created and made public to support developers in extracting information from Git repository. In this paper, we present PyDriller, a Python Framework that eases the process of mining Git. We compare our tool against the state-of-the-art Python Framework GitPython, demonstrating that PyDriller can achieve the same results with, on average, 50% less LOC and significantly lower complexity.URL: https://github.com/ishepard/pydrillerMaterials: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1327363Pre-print: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1327411",

### TO-DO ###
# make sure that when I call functions in error_handling, to use Pass or continue keyword to skip to the next thing
## ***** above is very important    
# copy all code over and adjust variable names and add necessary error handling for skipping messed up cases
# write code to get the previous commit (the one directly before the patch) this way we can compare that to the other hash.
# write code to get the specific path to the git repo of the selected FOSS Project for the specific patch commit from list in json. Fill PATH_SELECTED_REPO:str = "" variable 
# write code to get the vuln changes for CHANGES VULN COMMIT in the same format as the patch commit. Reusability!
# write code to get the parent directory with all the .git repos. Use error handling to make sure there is a .git file
# write code to get the name / directory of the FOSS project in the json and verify it exists in the parent directory with all .git repos.
# write code to write the original patch commit, directly prev commit, and the suspected vuln commit (or replace with error if unable to find), and changes to a new json file --> This is the solution
# write correct shebang at the top of script aka find location of python3 on RC
# put all paths into the .env file when I login to RC and find everything on my terminal. Can I carry the .env file with me??? How are env vars handled on RC?
# write code to write the commit changes to the json file (this is already kinda done, but I need to clean it up)
# add env variables to .env 
# go back through all setters in cve_config and write functions to actually get the data in the fields. Like for Vuln classifier. How do I get that info ?
# answer this question --> Where am I getting path selected repo, the repo that's selected for that particular iteration of for loop
## Create another file / section that focuses on analyzing the dataset once json data is processed that we have with python. Doesn't necessarily have to be 
## run in the script. It can be run after we get the data. Maybe make a jupyter notebook?
